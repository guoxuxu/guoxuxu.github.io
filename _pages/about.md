I am a Wallenberg-NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) advised by Prof. [Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084). Previously, I 
was a 
research fellow at 
[SCSE, NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse) under the supervision of Prof. [Boyang Albert Li](http://www.boyangli.org/).
I received my Ph.D. degree from NTU in 2023, where I was supervised by Prof. [Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/).


Research
------

My PhD research was mostly driven by developing methods to adapt Pretrained Language Models to low-resource domains against potential domain shift. 
Check out my [survey on the domain adaptation and generalization of pretrained lanaguage models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03154.pdf). 
My thesis, [data-efficient domain adaptation for pretrained language models](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/167965/2/PhD_Thesis_GuoXu.pdf), 
provides a few promising solutions to adapt PLMs to data-scarce domains under different resource constraints. 

As Generative AI, on top of large PLMs, increasingly plays an important role in our daily life, it is essential to address the following research problems: 
when do we need synthetic data generation, what is the quality of the generated content, and how to effectively and efficiently utilize the generated data? 
The significance of this research is to apply generative AI in practice and provide sustainable benefits to society.
