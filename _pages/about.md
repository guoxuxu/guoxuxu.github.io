I am a Wallenberg-NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) advised by Prof. [Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084). Previously, I 
was a 
research fellow at 
[SCSE, NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse) advised by Prof. [Boyang Albert Li](http://www.boyangli.org/).
I received my Ph.D. degree from NTU in 2023, where I was advised by Prof. [Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/).


Research
------

My PhD research was mostly driven by developing methods to adapt Pretrained Language Models to low-resource domains against potential domain shift. 
Check out my [survey on the domain adaptation and generalization of pretrained lanaguage models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03154.pdf). 
My thesis, [data-efficient domain adaptation for pretrained language models](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/167965/2/PhD_Thesis_GuoXu.pdf), 
provides a few promising solutions to adapt PLMs to data-scarce domains under different resource constraints. 

As Generative Artificial Intelligence increasingly plays an important role in our daily life, it is essential to address the following research problems: 
when do we need synthetic data generation, what kinds of data needs to be generated, and how to effectively and efficiently utilize the generated content? This necessitates an understanding of the interplay between 
Large Language Models and downstream low-resource applications, ensuring generative AI continues to be beneficial and sustainable.
