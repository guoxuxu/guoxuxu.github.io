I am a final-year PhD of Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I started my PhD in Jan 2019, since when I have been working with Professor [Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/), [Albert Boyang Li](http://www.boyangli.org/), and [Chunyan Miao](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084). 

Research
------
I have broad interests in deep learning optimization, transfer learning, and federated learning technologies for natural language understanding, healthcare data analytics, and multimodal understanding. My dissertation mainly focus on answering the question: *Why large-scale pratrained language models need domain adaptation techniques? How do I achieve this in a data-efficient manner?* In particular, my contributions to this topic pave the way from data augmentation, model optimization, and personalization perspectives. [link]()
