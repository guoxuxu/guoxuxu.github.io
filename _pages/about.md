I am a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering. I will join [SCSE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse), 
[NTU Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) as a research fellow, working with Prof. [Boyang Albert Li](http://www.boyangli.org/). 
Previously, I received my PhD from the same school at NTU, where I was advised by Prof. [Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/) and Prof. [Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084). 


Research
------
My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, 
motivated by a variety of real-world problems from our society, including healthcare and industrial scenarios.
I have been working on the transferability and efficiency problems of LLMs for a while. Feel free to reach out if you have related research to discuss.

During PhD, I was driven by developing methods to adapt large-scale pretrained language models to low-resource domains against potential domain shift. 
Check out my [survey on the domain adaptation and generalization of pretrained lanaguage models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03154.pdf). 
My thesis, titled [Data-efficient domain adaptation for pretrained language models](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/167965), 
focuses on a few typical problem settings and demonstrates potentially promising approaches to adapt LLMs to various kinds of data-scarce domains.
