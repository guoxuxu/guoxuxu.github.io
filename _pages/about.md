I am a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I am a research fellow at [SCSE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse), 
[NTU Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), advised by Prof. [Boyang Albert Li](http://www.boyangli.org/). 
Previously, I received my PhD from the same school at NTU, where I was advised by Prof. [Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/) and Prof. [Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084). 


Research
------
My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, 
motivated by a variety of real-world problems from our society, such as those in healthcare and industrial scenarios.
Recently, I am thinking about new ways to gain a comprehensive understanding of LLMs and better utilize them for research. Feel free to reach out if you have research questions to discuss.

During PhD, I was driven by developing methods to adapt large-scale pretrained language models to low-resource domains and against potential domain shift. 
Check out my [survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03154.pdf) about related literatures. My thesis, titled [Data-Efficient Domain Adaptation for Pretrained Language Models](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/167965), 
focuses on a few typical problem settings and demonstrates potentially promising approaches to adapt LLMs to various kinds of data-scarce domains.
