Research
------

My PhD research was mostly driven by developing methods to adapt Pretrained Language Models to low-resource domains against potential domain shift. 
Check out the survey, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03154.pdf" style="color: #4ca772; text-decoration: none;">on the domain adaptation and generalization of pretrained lanaguage models</a>. 
My thesis, <a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/167965/2/PhD_Thesis_GuoXu.pdf" style="color: #4ca772; text-decoration: none;">data-efficient domain adaptation for pretrained language models</a>, 
provides a few promising solutions to adapt PLMs to data-scarce domains under different resource constraints. 

As Generative AI, on top of large PLMs, increasingly plays an important role in our daily life, it is essential to think about the following research problems: 
when do we need synthetic data generation, what is the quality of the generated content, and how to effectively and efficiently utilize the generated data? 
This research will contribute to the use of generative AI in practice and provide sustainable benefits to society.
