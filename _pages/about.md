I am a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I am a Research Fellow at [SCSE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse), 
[NTU Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), working with Prof. [Boyang Albert Li](http://www.boyangli.org/). 
Previously, I received my PhD from the same school at NTU, where I was advised by Prof. [Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/) and Prof. [Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084). 


Research
------
My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, 
motivated by a variety of real-world problems from our society, including healthcare and industrial scenarios.
I have been working on the transferability and efficiency problems of LLMs for a while. Feel free to reach out.

My PhD research was mostly driven by developing methods to adapt LLMs to low-resource domains against potential domain shift. 
Check out my [survey on the domain adaptation and generalization of pretrained lanaguage models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03154.pdf). 
My thesis, [data-efficient domain adaptation for pretrained language models](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/167965/2/PhD_Thesis_GuoXu.pdf), 
provides a few potentially promising solutions to adapt LLMs to data-scarce domains under different resource constraints.
